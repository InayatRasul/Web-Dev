            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Pilaf , pilav or pilau  is a rice dish, or in some regions, a wheat dish, whose recipe usually involves cooking in stock or broth, adding spices, and other ingredients such as vegetables or meat, and employing some technique for achieving cooked grains that do not adhere</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Let's see plov's recepe</p>
            <ol style="margin-top: 0px;">
                <li>Cut the meat into 2×2″ cubes. Slice the onions in 1/4″ half circles.</li>
                <li>Once the meat and onions are ready, heat the pressure cooker on medium high heat + heat the oil and start frying the meat. Add salt, ground cumin and black pepper.</li>
                <li>
                    Fry until slightly brown on all sides and add onions. Fry onions along with the meat until onions are soft and golden brown. Add all the water, mix it and close the lid of the pressure cooker. Cook on medium-high heat for about 15-20 minutes. If you are using beef then you should give it a good 30 minutes to cook well.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile prepare the carrots for the next step. Clean, wash and julienne carrots like in the above pictures.</li>
                <li>
                    Once the time is up for the pressure cooker, open and empty it to another large nonstick pot (or Kazan) and put the pot back on the stove (medium heat). There will be no need to wait for the water to boil, since it is going to be pretty boiled up in the pressure cooker :) Place the carrots evenly on top of the meat and onions, but do not mix anything. Leave the pot like this for 15 minutes on medium heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wash the rice well at least 2-3 times. Drain the water and using a spatula place the rice over the carrots evenly.  The water that was initially added into the pressure cooker should be enough for the whole process. But if the water does not cover the rice (1 inch above) feel free to add a little more water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 10 minutes remove the lid and try the rice. If it is well-cooked, then mix the ingredients well.
                </li>
